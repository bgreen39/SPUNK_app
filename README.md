## User Agreement (SPUNK commandments)
The point of SPUNK is to help people connect with others in the form of friend groups. SPUNK is committed to providing a platform accessible to appropriate target audiences, and receiving feedback to enhance users’ SPUNK experience. Below are the following rules SPUNK users must agree to before utilizing SPUNK. Violation of SPUNK agreements can and will result in user account termination and depending on crime, litigation. Below are the SPUNK commandments.
### Be kind
SPUNK is not a safe space for racism, ableism, sexism, etc. If a SPUNK user is exhibiting unkind behavior of any kind, this will result in account termination.
### Be honest (No cheating)
This is not grade school. SPUNK is designed to help you find your niche. There is no right or wrong result. When you make up answers for the quizzes you cheat yourself out of the SPUNK experience. This is a general agreement for all users. 
### Be safe
SPUNK requires all users prior to meetups to be background checked. SPUNK is also designed in a way that none of your private information besides your name will be disclosed. Information will only be shared if given permission by the user. Any information you do not want disclosed, do not share with other users. 
### Be open-minded
Some personalities crash and groups may not go as planned. Don’t let that stop you from continuing your SPUNK journey!
